A Knora repository is a place for doing research. Knora can store texts, images, audio and video recordings, metadata, annotations, text markup, and any other data created by humanities research. It is designed for long-term preservation, and at the same time it provides powerful tools for searching, annotating, extending, linking, sharing, and reusing data.
