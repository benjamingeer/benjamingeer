A few years ago, I started a project called [Tondauer](https://tondauer.art/), to make Creative Commons licensed musical editions. It happened because I was learning to play
[Felix Mendelssohn's Prelude Op. 104a, No. 2 (MWV U 123)](https://tondauer.art/2021/03/mendelssohn-prelude-mwv-u-123/),
and wondered why different editions had different notes. It turned out that the
composer's manuscript had been lost, and that the piece wasn't published until after his death. All editions are therefore editors' attempts to reconstruct what he might have intended. I had learned something about how critical editions are made while working in the field of digital humanities. So I decided to make my own critical edition, to make all these editorial choices clearer.

More recently I've been working with musicologist Florence Launay on editions of forgotten works by female composers.
