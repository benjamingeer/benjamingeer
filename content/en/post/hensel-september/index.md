In 1841, Fanny Hensel (1805–1847) wrote *Das Jahr* (The Year), a
large-scale piano cycle with a movement for each month of the
year. She published "September" in 1846 as part of her Op. 2, but *Das
Jahr* was first published in its entirety in 1989. Subsequently, a
magnificent [revised autograph
manuscript](http://resolver.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/SBB00019D1B00000000)
was discovered, in which each movement is copied on paper of a
different colour, illustrated with a drawing by Hensel's husband
Wilhelm, and preceded by a poetic epigram. Furore Verlag has
published [a critical edition](https://furore-verlag.de/en/produkt/das-jahr-moderne-notenedition-2/).

Considering the music, poetry, and illustrations together, Marion
Wilson Kimber sees the work as depicting not simply the cycle of the
year, but also the stages of an individual's life.[^Kimber]

The epigram for "September" is from Goethe's poem [*An den
Mond*](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/An_den_Mond) (To the Moon):

> Fließe, fließe, lieber Fluß<br>
> Nimmer werd’ ich froh.

Translation:

> Flow, flow, dear river<br>
> Never will I be happy.

There are countless interpretations of the poem. For Tobias Klein:

> The retreat into nature and especially into the solitude of the
> night is presented as consolation in the face of the disappointments
> and frustrations to which the individual is exposed in
> society.... The river appears in this context as a symbol of change
> and transience, as well as of ambivalence, as it can be both
> destructive ... and invigorating....[^Klein]

The piece displays "an artful application of the three-hand
technique", "in which a melody played by the thumbs in the middle
register of the piano was surrounded by material assigned to the other
fingers above and below, to create the illusion of three hands at the
keyboard".[^Todd_three_hand_technique] The harpist Elias Parish-Alvars
(1808–1849) invented this technique, the pianist Sigismund Thalberg
(1812–1871) transferred it to the piano,[^Walker] and it became widely
used in the 1830s. In "September", the upper voice seems to suggest
the flowing water of the river.

The movement's ingenious harmonic development[^Todd_September] is an
example of how Hensel's work anticipated the avant-garde of the second
half of the 19th century.[^Manning]
