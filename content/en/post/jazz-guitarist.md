I started playing jazz guitar around the time I went to university. I
wanted to combine the improvisational tradition of jazz with non-tonal
harmony and large-scale structures. But I thought I should start with
bebop.

In 1995â€“96, while working as an English language teaching assistant in
France, I had the opportunity to play in an amateur big band as well
as a quintet:

Here are some earlier recordings, from 1991:

When I was about 30 I stopped playing, mainly out of frustration from
my own slow progress and from the difficulty of trying to be a
musician while needing to earn a living in some other way. I wish I
had kept at it.
