The novel *On the Greenwich Line*, by the Egyptian writer Shady Lewis, came out in 2019. Since reading it in 2023, I have given [the original Arabic version](https://archive.org/details/20210716_20210716_2223) or the [French translation](https://www.actes-sud.fr/sur-le-meridien-de-greenwich) to many of my friends, and now I will be giving other friends the [English translation](https://www.peirenepress.com/shop/books/on-the-greenwich-line/) that is due out next month. With great sensitivity, Lewis has written a very funny comic novel about immigration, racism and bureaucracy in London, where he is a social worker. In a lecture at the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris in April 2023, he said that when the news is so full of horrors every day that we become inured to them, humour can revive our feelings. The treatment was effective for me.
