In 2023 I wrote a program that makes spreadsheets of data about traffic accidents in France: [accicalc](https://github.com/benjamingeer/accicalc). The data is available online, but difficult to work with. This little program is useful if, for example, you want details of all accidents involving pedestrians or cyclists in a given municipality, including the address or geographical coordinates.
