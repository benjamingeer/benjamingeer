abstract: The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is a widely accepted and fast-growing standard to present images as web resources. The IIIF standard defines a URL syntax to access, transform and reformat the desired image. An IIIF server converts the image on the fly based on the desired parameters and transfers the image using the HTTP protocol to the client. We designed and implemented an advanced, extremely flexible, fully IIIF-compliant server in C++11 offering advanced features that go beyond the IIIF standard. Due to its flexibility, it can easily be integrated into existing environments, and thus facilitates the transformation of existing archiving platforms to support the IIIF protocol.
