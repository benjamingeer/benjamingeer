  <p>I started playing jazz guitar around the time I went to university. I
wanted to combine the improvisational tradition of jazz with non-tonal
harmony and large-scale structures. But I thought I should start with
bebop.</p>
<p>In 1995–96, while working as an English language teaching assistant in
France, I had the opportunity to play in an amateur big band as well
as a quintet:</p>

<p>When I was about 30 I stopped playing, mainly out of frustration from
my own slow progress and from the difficulty of trying to be a
musician while needing to earn a living in some other way. I wish I
had kept at it.</p>
