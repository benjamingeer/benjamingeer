  <p>In 2020 I started a project called <a href="https://tondauer.art/" target="_blank">Tondauer</a>, to make Creative Commons licensed editions of sheet music. It happened because of the Covid-19 lockdown that year: I was learning to play <a href="https://tondauer.art/2021/03/mendelssohn-prelude-mwv-u-123/" target="_blank">Felix Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Prelude Op. 104a, No. 2 (MWV U 123)</a>, because it suited my mood of restless frustration at the time.</p>
<p>I started with a 19th-century edition that could be downloaded for free. Then I bought an edition with fingerings, and wondered why it had different notes. I looked in vain for the composer&rsquo;s manuscript, but found only an earlier draft. I had been reading R. Larry Todd&rsquo;s biography of Mendelssohn, so I emailed him to ask if he knew where the manuscript of the final version was, and he replied that it hadn&rsquo;t been found. This meant that the only sources were the first editions, which were published after the composer&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>I had learned something about how critical editions are made while working in the field of digital humanities. So I decided to make my own critical edition. Over several months, as libraries and archives gradually reopened, I got digital reproductions of the first German and British editions. The two editors had worked together to publish them simultaneously, but they didn&rsquo;t have the same notes, either. In my edition, I tried to make a plausible explanation of what had happened, and reconstruct the composer&rsquo;s intentions as well as possible. In the end I tried to make the edition I wished I had had, and added fingerings with the help of <a href="https://www.roskellacademy.com/" target="_blank">Penelope Roskell</a>.</p>
<p>More recently I&rsquo;ve been working with musicologist Florence Launay on editions of forgotten works by female composers, starting with Armande de Polignac&rsquo;s <a href="https://tondauer.art/2022/10/polignac-preludes/" target="_blank">Preludes for Piano</a>, which had survived only in a single copy of the first edition, preserved by her descendants. Florence had photocopied it, and pianists had been recording the pieces using photocopies of that photocopy. Now that we&rsquo;ve published a corrected edition with Florence&rsquo;s preface, I hope more pianists will enjoy playing these Preludes.</p>
