She published “September” in 1846 as part of her Op. 2, but Das Jahr was first published in its entirety in 1989. Subsequently, a magnificent revised autograph manuscript was discovered, in which each movement is copied on paper of a different colour, illustrated with a drawing by Hensel’s husband Wilhelm, and preceded by a poetic epigram. Furore Verlag has published a critical edition.\nConsidering the music, poetry, and illustrations together, Marion Wilson Kimber sees the work as depicting not simply the cycle of the year, but also the stages of an individual’s life.1\nThe epigram for “September” is from Goethe’s poem An den Mond (To the Moon):\nFließe, fließe, lieber Fluß\nNimmer werd’ ich froh.\nTranslation:\nFlow, flow, dear river\nNever will I be happy.\nThere are countless interpretations of the poem. For Tobias Klein:\nThe retreat into nature and especially into the solitude of the night is presented as consolation in the face of the disappointments and frustrations to which the individual is exposed in society…. The river appears in this context as a symbol of change and transience, as well as of ambivalence, as it can be both destructive … and invigorating….2\nThe piece displays “an artful application of the three-hand technique”, “in which a melody played by the thumbs in the middle register of the piano was surrounded by material assigned to the other fingers above and below, to create the illusion of three hands at the keyboard”.3 The harpist Elias Parish-Alvars (1808–1849) invented this technique, the pianist Sigismund Thalberg (1812–1871) transferred it to the piano,4 and it became widely used in the 1830s. In “September”, the upper voice seems to suggest the flowing water of the river.\nThe movement’s ingenious harmonic development5 is an example of how Hensel’s work anticipated the avant-garde of the second half of the 19th century.6\nMarian Wilson Kimber, Fanny Hensel’s Seasons of Life: Poetic Epigrams, Vignettes, and Meaning in Das Jahr. ↩︎\nTobias Klein, Interpretation: An den Mond – Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. ↩︎\nR.

Focusing on the case of research in Egypt, I argue that degree programs are not designed to enable students to learn Arabic as a second language well enough to do research that involves talking with people there. Egyptian state institutions also restrict both ethnographic and archival research. These obstacles are likely to deter research on ordinary social practices, on vernacular cultural production, and on archival materials, and to favor research on canonical texts. Moreover, in a field such as Islamic studies, in which researchers can produce work that responds to the demands of non-specialist audiences, students may be tempted to overgeneralize from these texts, e.g. by relying on them to draw conclusions about Islam in general. I suggest ways for universities and faculty to help students avoid these pitfalls.","tags":[],"title":"Training Scholars to Study Non-Scholarly Life","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Geer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"023d9e1db68c4e31bf852d7ffde5a1a1","permalink":"https://benjamingeer.name/publication/yousry/","publishdate":"2021-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yousry/","section":"publication","summary":"This chapter surveys the career of the Egyptian filmmaker Yousry Nasrallah (born 1952).

Under the Mubarak regime in Egypt, the March 9 Group for University Autonomy, a small group of academics, campaigned against the interference of the state security apparatus and the ruling party in academic affairs and campus life. This article suggests that the group’s survival in that context, and its ability to organize successful campaigns within certain limits, depended on the involvement of highly accomplished academics, some of whom are well-known outside academia, on its practice of a particular type of participatory democracy, and on its focus on institutional autonomy from the state. All these assets became liabilities following the revolutionary uprising of January 2011, and the group has to a large extent demobilized as a result.","tags":[],"title":"Autonomy and Symbolic Capital in an Academic Social Movement: The March 9 Group in Egypt","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Geer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"6aad632eb6eb4d81dc799d4ff1bf17a6","permalink":"https://benjamingeer.name/publication/phd/","publishdate":"2021-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phd/","section":"publication","summary":"This thesis considers the effects of nationalism on the autonomy of intellectuals in Egypt. I argue that nationalism limits intellectuals’ ability to challenge social hierarchies, political authority and economic inequality, and that it has been more readily used to legitimise new forms of domination in competition with old ones. I analyse similarities between religion and nationalism, using the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu together with cognitive linguistics. Focusing mainly on the similarities between priests and nationalist intellectuals, and secondarily between prophets and charismatic nationalist political leaders, I show that nationalism and religion are based on relatively similar concepts, which lend themselves to similar strategies for gaining credibility, recognition and moral authority. I present case studies of a few nationalist intellectuals, focusing on ones who advocated views that later became dominant. The translator and teacher Rifa‘a Rafi‘ al-Tahtawi, who was trained as a religious scholar before studying secular subjects in France, brought nationalism to Egypt by blending European nationalist concepts with centuries-old concepts from Islamic religious and literary traditions. In the early 20th century, the nationalism of intellectuals such as Muhammad Husayn Haykal enabled them to compete with men of religion for prestige and political influence, and also served particular class and professional interests. Tawfiq al-Hakim’s concept of the charismatic national leader influenced the young Gamal Abdel Nasser, who became a successful nationalist prophet and military autocrat. Ihsan ‘Abd al-Quddus articulated the concept of the nationalist martyr, who dies for his country; this concept also contributed to Nasser’s charisma. Both al-Hakim and al-Quddus arguably lost autonomy under Nasser’s regime. Al-Hakim was unable to criticise the regime until after Nasser’s death. Al-Quddus was imprisoned and tortured for advocating democracy, then became one of the most fervent supporters of Nasser’s autocracy.","tags":[],"title":"The Priesthood of Nationalism in Egypt: Duty, Authority, Autonomy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Geer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"c2110c45bde8686fd5a43209ec746aef","permalink":"https://benjamingeer.name/publication/karnak/","publishdate":"2021-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/karnak/","section":"publication","summary":"Similarities between religion and nationalism are well known but not well understood. They canbe explained by drawing on Pierre Bourdieu’s sociological theory in order to consider symbolic interests and the strategies employed to advance them. In both religion and nationalism, the “strategy of the prophets” relies on charisma while the “strategy of the priests” relies on cultural capital. In 20th-century Egypt, nationalism permitted intellectuals whose cultural capital was mainly secular, such as Naguib Mahfouz, to become “priests of the nation” in order to compete with the ʿulamaʾ for prestige and influence. However, it severely limited their autonomy, particularly after Nasser took power and became a successful nationalist prophet. Mahfouz’s novel *Al-Karnak*, which explores the fate of the Nasser regime’s political prisoners and the effects of Egypt’s 1967 military defeat, reflects this limitation. Under a nationalist regime, the film adaptation of the novel contributed to Mahfouz’s heteronomy.","tags":[],"title":"Prophets and Priests of the Nation: Naguib Mahfouz’s Karnak Café and the 1967 Crisis in Egypt","type":"publication"}]
