Gravsearch (Virtual Graph Search), a SPARQL transformer developed as part of a web-based API, is designed to support complex searches that are desirable in humanities research, while avoiding these disadvantages. It does this by introducing server software that mediates between the client and the triplestore, transforming an input SPARQL query into one or more queries executed by the triplestore. This design suggests a practical way to go beyond some limitations of the ways that RDF data has generally been made available.","tags":[],"title":"Gravsearch: Transforming SPARQL to query humanities data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lukas Rosenthaler","Peter Fornaro","Andrea Bianco","Benjamin Geer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"af0fc875e41d26c0ccdf65b17b8ea6a2","permalink":"https://benjamingeer.name/publication/sipi/","publishdate":"2021-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sipi/","section":"publication","summary":"The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is a widely accepted and fast-growing standard to present images as web resources. The IIIF standard defines a URL syntax to access, transform and reformat the desired image. An IIIF server converts the image on the fly based on the desired parameters and transfers the image using the HTTP protocol to the client. We designed and implemented an advanced, extremely flexible, fully IIIF-compliant server in C++11 offering advanced features that go beyond the IIIF standard. Due to its flexibility, it can easily be integrated into existing environments, and thus facilitates the transformation of existing archiving platforms to support the IIIF protocol.","tags":[],"title":"Simple Image Presentation Interface (SIPI): An IIIF-based Image Server","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1442494800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1442494800,"objectID":"0a691599e4de3fc0ce264512acefeafa","permalink":"https://benjamingeer.name/talk/knora-a-generic-storage-system-and-api-for-accessing-and-reusing-digital-qualitative-research-data-in-the-humanities/","publishdate":"2021-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/knora-a-generic-storage-system-and-api-for-accessing-and-reusing-digital-qualitative-research-data-in-the-humanities/","section":"event","summary":"We describe Knora (Knowledge Organization, Representation, and Annotation), and discuss the lessons learned from its development and use.","tags":[],"title":"Knora: A Generic Storage System and API for Accessing and Reusing Digital Qualitative Research Data in the Humanities","type":"event"}]
